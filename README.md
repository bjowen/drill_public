# Drill

Drill is a relatively simple code for deep directed continuous gravitational
wave searches for isolated neutron stars. It was developed by Benjamin J. Owen, Lee Lindblom, Luciano Soares Pinheiro, and Binod Rajbhandari.

## Usage

cd drill/code && Drill.sh
The code directory contains scripts normally run by Drill.sh, the search
directory is where you run searches after the first step, and the tools
directory contains scripts to be run manually for checking candidates etc.
